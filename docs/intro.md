# Introduction


Let's discover **How We're Harnessing AI to Transform Drug Discovery**.

## Antibody Design

- Drug design remains a challenging endeavor due to the complexity of the involved design space. Artificial Intelligence provides a unique shot at the problem due to its capability of enabling efficient horizon exploration.

- We are applying our AI capabilities in screening and de novo generation of antibodies and small molecule drugs against challenging targets such as intrinsically disordered pathogenic proteoforms involved in Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

## Multidisciplinary Expertise

- Our team consists of an ideal mix of members having strong experience in both the fields of biophysics and AI. We strongly believe in the importance of a multidisciplinary team for tackling the problem.

## Biophysics Meets Deep Learning

- Deep Learning has revolutionized many fields but still remains in the nascent stages for drug design.

- Models like AlphaFold provide a strong foundation for the field but end-to-end solutions need to go far beyond. Hence, we develop novel architectures, built using biophysics principles at the core.
